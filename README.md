# Data-Visualization-with-D3
FreeCodeCamp's exercises to practice D3 and SVG

## Introduction to the Data Visualization with D3 Challenges
D3.js, or D3, stands for Data Driven Documents. D3 is a JavaScript library to create dynamic and interactive data visualizations in the browser. It's built to work with common web standards, namely HTML, CSS, and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG).

D3 takes input data and maps it into a visual representation of that data. It supports many different data formats. D3 lets you bind (or attach) the data to the Document Object Model (DOM). You use HTML or SVG elements with D3's built-in methods to transform the data into a visualization.

D3 gives you a lot of control over the presentation of data. This section covers the basic functionality and how to create visualizations with the D3 library.

## Create a Bar for Each Data Point in the Set
The last challenge added only one rectangle to the svg element to represent a bar. Here, you'll combine what you've learned so far about data(), enter(), and SVG shapes to create and append a rectangle for each data point in dataset.

A previous challenge showed the format for how to create and append a div for each item in dataset:
<pre><code>
d3.select("body").selectAll("div")
  .data(dataset)
  .enter()
  .append("div")
</pre></code>
There are a few differences working with rect elements instead of divs. The rects must be appended to an svg element, not directly to the body. Also, you need to tell D3 where to place each rect within the svg area. The bar placement will be covered in the next challenge.
